# score-sources
This repository contains the sources to most of the scores I've transposed using MuseScore Studio (https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore).

Using said tool, you can edit these scores, export them as MIDI, PDF or MP3 files (to name a few formats).

For a quick preview, you can go to my profile at https://musescore.com/user/87506857.
